# Don't put files or directories specific to your operating system or development environment here.
# For those project-unrelated files and directories create your personal global .gitignore file:
#
# git config --global core.excludesFile '~/.gitignore'
#
# Examples of what should be ignored in your global .gitignore
# - configuration, caches and other files generated by your IDE
# - files generated by your operating system (like .DS_Store on macOS)
#
# You are the only person interested in those files and other developers might not even know what they are about.
#
# Examples of what should be ignored here:
# - binaries built from the source code and stored under /bin
# - temporary code generated during build process, like protobuf (not a case for now)
